lil shit chess engine.

This is my first ever chess engine. It was originally coded in Python, but I've converted it to C++ due to peer pressure from the Stockfish dc.

It's not UCI compatible yet but it will be eventually.

I also plan to implement somewhat important chess features such as castling and en passant in the future, as well as iterative deepening.

BTW, my movegen is perfectly fine.
